# Setup Environment

```{r, setup, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(tidyverse)
library(naniar)
library(Hmisc)
library(GGally)

train <- read_csv('../data/CaseStudy2-data_train.csv')
```

# Data Exploration

A data dictionary was not given. So start by exploring the variables to get a sense of what is included. A simple data dictionary will be built. See './analysis/data/README.md' for more details.

```{r}
names(train)
```
